A rudimentary image segmentation algorithm and the Traveling Salesman Problem

This repository includes two application of Markov Chains:
1. use the Metropolis algorithm to simulate the Gibbs law and develop a rudimentary image segmentation algorithm.
2. use the simulated annealing algorithm to solve the constrained Traveling Salesman Problem.
